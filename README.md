# PriCoSha_Project

PriCoSha a system for privately sharing content items
among groups of people that i made for the Databases Project. The advantage of this system is that it emphasizes on individual privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them control over the content access, and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal information. For this project,
I used
* Python Flask
* MySQL
